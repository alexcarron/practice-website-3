			<h2> Morbius Sweep </h2>
			<p> 
				A series of parody memes ironically celebrating the 2022 superhero film Morbius as a massive commercial and critical success despite the movie being largely panned. Originating from the /r/moviecirclejerk subreddit, the trend gained a massive presence on Twitter in early April 2022 following the negative critic and audience reviews of the film, as well as the It's Morbin' Time catchphrase shortly after.

			<h2> It's Morbin Time </h2>
			<p>
				A fictional catchphrase attributed to the title character in the 2022 superhero movie Morbius as part of the ongoing joke surrounding the film of inventing aspects of the movie.
